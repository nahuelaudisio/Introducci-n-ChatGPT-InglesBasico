Partes de una oración

The parts of speech are the categories of the words in traditional English grammar. We can divide them into eight main groups (or nine, if you count determiners): nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.
The following chart contains the parts of speech, their functions, and some examples of words and sentences.

PARTS OF SPEECH
PART OF SPEECH	FUNCTION	EXAMPLE	EXAMPLE
NOUN	Names, places, things, or ideas.	Daniel / New York / dog / notebook / music	Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.
PRONOUN	Replaces nouns and other pronouns.	I / she / they / him / them / who / some / this	Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.
VERB	Action or state of being. It tells what happens in the sentence.	be / go / eat / work / play / like / study / write / read / speak / watch / listen / live	Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.
ADJECTIVE	Describes, modifies, or gives information about nouns and pronouns.	hot / nice / big / wrong / intelligent / beautiful / smart / interesting	I have a nice car. Mark is intelligent.
ADVERB	Describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.	happily / quickly / well / often / really / very / always / too	They always watch tv. You sing very well!
PREPOSITION	Links a noun or pronoun to other words in the sentence.	to / for / but / in / on / at / up / over / from / under / of / with / about / near	The pen is under the table. I go there on Friday.
CONJUNCTION	Connects words, clauses, phrases, and ideas in a sentence.	for / and / but / or / yet / with / is / as…as / because / while	I drink coffee and tea. He likes blue, but he doesn’t like green.
INTERJECTION	Expresses strong emotions or reactions.	oh / wow / ouch / aha / gosh / well / phew / whoops / hooray	Wow! That’s beautiful. Ouch! It hurts.
There is a discussion about determiners being a part of speech since they have similar functions to adjectives, articles, and pronouns. There are four types of determiners in English: articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, and possessives.

DETERMINER
Specifies and identifies nouns and pronouns.
that / those / some / few / such / the / a / an
The dog is barking.
I have some oranges.
As we saw with the determiners, many words in English have more than one job. For example, “close” can be a verb, a noun, an adjective, and even an adverb. The spelling is the same, but the meanings are different.

VERB: Can you please close the door?

NOUN: It came to a close.

ADJECTIVE: We are close friends.

ADVERB: Don’t be so close to each other.

It is crucial to understand the parts of speech, so you define the exact word order and the correct use of punctuation in a sentence.
Now, try to write sentences using as many parts of speech as you can. Here is an example:

Oh,	he	and	his	old	dog	walked	to	the	park	slowly.
Interj.	Pron.	Conj.	Det.	Adj.	Noun	Verb	Prep.	Det.	Noun	Adv.
